Speaker 1  0:01  
Awesome. All right, this is recording it cool. Okay, so this is the first of many discussions for Danny's business, which we don't really know the name of it yet, but the premise is that we want to pull on the thread of the universe a little bit and start to unravel something to help, hopefully millions, or even hundreds of millions, or maybe even billions of people take steps towards being property owners and having their own individual wealth.

Speaker 2  0:30  
Yeah, we want to be able to take the command and control away from these larger corporations that are only designed to exploit, let's say BlackRock, for example, like exploit people's housing, exploit people's abilities, exploit people's natural resources, take that away from the people for their sole purpose of profit, for their shareholders and the owners. So what we want to do is make every single person have the ability to control their selves, themselves, control their finances, control their future, control their potential, and recognize their own value and potential. And by doing so, it will greaten the potential of humanity as a race. It will aid people in recognizing their own potential or values, or eight people in recognizing their own greatness, genius, finding their own way. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:28  
exactly. Can

Speaker 1  1:32  
you talk a little bit more about the Blackrock thing, and talk about what Blackrock does right now? If it's wrong, oh, so

Speaker 2  1:38  
Blackrock is the largest corporation within the states, there are people that say, and very, a very large amount of people that say that it controls the government in not just the USA, but in multiple different countries. Because because of its wealth, this company has so many subsidiary companies that it is speculized as having a greater wealth than the United States as a country, even with their debt. So this company has now started purchasing hoses in Canada, and their main goal with properties, which is only one facet of their organization, is to purchase personal properties, homes, houses that are duplexes, single family livings, etc, just to rent out to people. So the company owns every property, and they just want to make every single person a living working slave, a salary slave. And what we would be able to do to fight against that is use our company to give people the financial freedom to purchase their own properties or use the properties that we purchase. And we're not going to exploit people for gain on this and

Speaker 1  2:38  
build their credit and build their trust, build their credit system.

Speaker 2  2:43  
That's another thing. With the grants and the bursaries, we would be able to help people with their credit and so when I'll just say the basis of what the grants are, we want to go to a youth High School, and give at least five people the full ride for anything that they want to do. We would give them. We would give five people the full ride for anything that they want to do. We would just need them to come with to us with a sales pitch on themselves and what their vision is, what their passion is. We want to help people recognize their passion, because that is the first step in self realization and the first step to true happiness. Because if you're always doing something that you're passionate about, that means that you can do it for work, and if you always do something that you love for work, then you don't feel like you work a day in your life, which will also create people that want to work seven or eight days a week. Now with the full ride, another thing that we can do is we would have the full ride that I want to do is give people allowances. We want to pay for their groceries. We want to pay for everything that they need their hosing, which would also be attributed or contributed to by our housing ownership with the company that we're starting. But that way, we can have them with their own personal credit cards. They would go and buy groceries every week or however long, and our company would pay off the groceries through that credit card, which is under their name, which will build their credit from the age of 19. Now, our company can do many other things in that facet, for sure, but I think that that would be the first step which many people mess up with. Many people blunder with and become greatly in debt or destroy their credit before they're even started.

Speaker 1  4:37  
People try to take too many steps at once, and they take out a lot of loans so they can start at the wrong business like business, like a restaurant.

Speaker 2  4:43  
No, they just take out credit cards like every like, when I was younger, I took out a credit card because they allowed it. Banks advertise it, but they don't allow you to have that financial knowledge as to what to do with the credit card. So I didn't realize it affected credit but I maxed out my credit card, just like I would say. I don't know the statistic, but it must be like 50% of people that get credit cards right out of high school usually Max them,

Speaker 1  5:09  
Max them, at least for a while, and then they spend a long time trying to pay them down as well. Pay them

Speaker 2  5:13  
down. My sister's 38 years old, and she's still paying off credit card debt from

Speaker 1  5:16  
people into the cycle of going after payday loans and all the other things that they need so they can get the money exactly,

Speaker 2  5:22  
which just destroys credit further. And then large corporations like banks will then look at the credit applications, the credit checks by these things like money mart or cash money, and if you even apply for a loan from them, if they do a credit check on you, then the larger corporations that do mortgages, or the insurance for mortgage will deny you just because they do a credit

Speaker 1  5:45  
check. It also puts people into a mindset of scarcity as well, because a mindset of poverty, yeah, a scarcity we call it scarcity mindset and abundance mindset. So yeah, abundance mindset means I'm looking for opportunities, and a scarcity mindset says I'm trying to avoid more problems. Yeah, and when you're in a scarcity mindset, it's really hard to be creative, because everything sounds like more

Speaker 2  6:05  
work. And if you're in financial debt, money is not the root of happiness, but a lack of money is the cause of stress, and people that are under stress will only focus on the stress, and it will stop them from being free and truly happy.

Speaker 1  6:24  
So I want to examine Maslow's hierarchy briefly as a part of this discussion. So we've discussed the psychological strain of debt, and especially of personal individual poverty, where people have limited personal finances, and this creates a cycle of potentially making consistently more conservative choices to stay within the bounds of their current situation.

Speaker 2  6:47  
So when a great example of this, just want to highlight

Speaker 1  6:51  
this for a second, but I think the key thing is, like, you know that college, that high school kid, let's keep in the abstract for a sec. Yeah, that high school kid that you described in their eight they're 16 or 18 years old, they've got their first job. They get their first credit card. Because when they get their first job, they need to be taking up a credit card by being in school. I just want to step through really quick. But if you're in your first if you're in high school and you get your first job when you're 16, the first thing that their employer asks you for is, you need a direct deposit slip from your bank. So from this your choice to try and increase your own freedom. The first thing that you hear is, okay, I have to go get a bank so you go to bank account, and you get the direct deposit form from the bank, and it's all very complicated, and the bank's probably not super nice to you, because, like, you're broke, and you're going in there, and they're like, Ah, screw this guy, another kid coming in our bank. But they get your email, and they get your phone number, and as soon as you got some savings in that account. What are they gonna do next? They're gonna offer you a credit card, maybe like, a month into your new job. You're working a couple days a week in between school and advertising, you're trying to save for university. And they're like, Hey, you're doing really well. You have amazing credit. Your credit's 900 right now. You're doing so well, why don't you sign up for credit card, which, by the way, your credit card gives you access to free movie tickets if you spend enough. Shows you the benefits. It shows you all the benefits of spending more on your credit card. So it gets you thinking, Okay, I gotta spend more money. And now you're thinking, Okay, I got all this money. I got this job. I'm doing, all right? I still live with my parents, so I don't have a lot of costs. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go take this nice girl that I just met on a date. I'm gonna try to impress these friends, or, as you have that extra fun, right? Or I'm gonna, I'm gonna go on this little trip to try and, like, explore what I can do next year at university. I'm gonna go, like, well, take a bus or a plane to go see this university, because I, I got accepted to this cool University, and like, they're, they're inviting me to go out there, and I wanna see what it looks like. So yeah, then suddenly, now you pay for that on your credit card, and you pay that off out of the amount of money that you're making at your difficult job. And now suddenly, suddenly, your savings are down by a lot, but you got those free movie tickets, so it's okay, yeah, but now what you're thinking is, oh, shit, my savings are down. I need to refill and get back to where I was before I was so proud of myself for my financial success, right? And then the thing that happens then is now you're thinking about how to get a job that pays you a little bit more, but you're not thinking about getting a job that's going to pay you enough to pay off 50 credit card bills you could get it because the thing most people don't realize this, but there's a lot of jobs you can get, self employed or otherwise, that can pay you so much that that credit card bill or the amount that you had in that bank account when you 17 years old. You're 17 years old, you can get that in a day in many different ways. There's so many ways you could get that 1500 or that $500 in a day working just about any kind of like serious adult job. But it's really hard to imagine that when you're just a kid, because your parents probably don't tell you about the mortgage or how much the rent costs. Nobody teaches you about this, right? So then now you're thinking, Okay, well, I just need to get a little bit better job. So when you get that offer to move from the McDonald's to the Foot Locker, where they pay you an extra $3 if you sell more sneakers, you're like, oh, wow, I got this great deal. I make an extra $20 a day. This is fantastic. Yeah, I'm gonna pay off this credit card bill twice as fast now, right? And then you don't, and then, and then more credit. You don't, because they give you more credit, exactly. And there's this cycle. And so what the smart entrepreneurs do is that they get out of this cycle, because they usually, a lot of the smart entrepreneurs, they know how to control their emotions. So Maslow's hierarchy is what I wanted to get into. It's got physiological needs down at the bottom. That's the first foundational layer of the whole system. Physiological is mostly psychological. It means breathing, food, water, shelter, clothing and sleep. But what it really means is the feeling of being able to plan, not having that scarcity mindset, being able to think, okay, maybe this other problem that I'm thinking about taking on that might be something I can think about, right? I have enough space, and then the safety and security is the next layer of Maslow's hierarchy, and that says health, employment, property, family and social ability. And this is where a lot of people get stuck in life. A lot of people get stuck at safety. They get a job that's comfortable. This is what the movie Fight Club is about. Yeah, he's got the dead end job, he's got the IKEA backed apartment, and he's got a little 401, K that he's working on. So when he turns 60, he'll be able to retire, but he doesn't have enough freedom to be able to find love. Yeah, he's not able to step outside his shell, because if he does something wrong, maybe he goes into work and they're not gonna like him,

Speaker 2  11:13  
right? It's also being scared of that debt. If you lose your job, which you're stuck at because of the debt, you're not able to leave it for even a week,

Speaker 1  11:19  
especially if you have college loans, all that kind of stuff, there's so many ways to end up with lots of debt. Yeah, and a lot of people also, if they don't go to college, even if they do to go to college too, what they end up doing is they move away from their parents, right? Because they've got this job and it's steady, so then they're like, Okay, I can afford an apartment. I want some I'm gonna get my own apartment. You sign up for an apartment they get you signed a 12 month lease. Yeah, now you're not. You can't quit that job now. Now you need to work that job. And you guys sometimes work overtime just to cover your expenses, yeah, because you want to take this pretty girl on a date. Now you got to work overtime. Where's your thought? Where's your free time? Yeah, so then you chase that love and belong, and that takes the last few hours out of your week. Yeah? Because if you're a normal person, you sleep six to eight hours a day, you become a working sleep. If you sleep six to eight hours a day, that only leaves 16 hours every day. Yeah, you got the weekends free, but you usually spend those on trying to make some friends or feel some attachment, love for work too, and an hour commuting

Speaker 2  12:12  
minimum for most people, right, eight hours a day plus an hour commute, plus

Speaker 1  12:15  
20 minutes to shower in the morning, put on the right shoes, make sure you look okay in the mirror. Yeah, 510 minutes to brush your teeth and do your skincare before bed presentable the next day.

Speaker 2  12:26  
So it never actually leaves you. You're always focused on that. And if you're in a dead end job, then you don't see any whale whatsoever. Add

Speaker 1  12:34  
an extra hour for trying to think about what you're gonna do next, maybe reading a book, because you want to broaden your horizons now you got no time left in your day, yeah? Date the wrong person out of high school. That's your whole evening gone. And

Speaker 2  12:44  
if you don't do every like self care thing every day, which only takes that takes up the rest of your day entirely, because you want it to go on my dates, and the next day you're behind, and then everything else slips, and then your finances slip, and then you're just more in debt and more into this terrible

Speaker 1  12:58  
cycle. And that's not even to speak of like doing something healthy, like going to the gym or trying to and all of those things going going outside, sunshine, right? Slow your time. What are you gonna do? You do that on the weekend, I guess, right? Yeah, when you have a moment, if you're lucky, yeah? You know. And so this is the cycle that a lot of people fall into, and a lot of people get stuck. And this is only level three of Maslow's hierarchies, love and belonging. And so people aspire to love and belonging. Most people get into a cycle where they're aspiring to have love and belonging in their life. And the next layer beyond love and belonging is self esteem. And so what that means is until you get love and belonging and you have consistent love and belonging, it's very hard to have self esteem. And so a lot of people will stick with the wrong friends, they'll stick with the wrong romantic partner, yeah? And they'll stick with it because that gives them the feeling that they're good enough, yeah, and that they have the confidence to go out and try that next thing, and then 1020, years later, when they've scraped together a little bit of savings, that's when they'll try that hobby. That's when the midlife crisis comes out after they've had a couple kids, because they feel like they have to, after they have a house that they can't afford, that's when they go and they they realize that they're about to die. Yeah, they turn 40, and they realize

Speaker 2  14:12  
their life is half over. They never got to do what they wanted to

Speaker 1  14:16  
do. Life expectancy is 70. Yeah, people think life expectancy is 100 we retire people in their 60s, and life expectancy for men is 70. And that's, that's the reality of it all. That's the life. And most people never even really get to the love and belonging. Some people basically can get to self esteem. This is where the dad bod comes from, right? Is the the guy who's like, fuck it. You know what? I'm the shit. I made it through all this. I'm all right. I got my family, I got my kids, I got my job. I got my 1999 Chevrolet car. I liked, I like the way my life is going. And you know what, back in the backyard there, man, I got a shed. Yeah, in that shed. Oh, man, I go in there and I have my arm chair. I just read a nice Coronavirus book. Put my feet up. Yeah? That's how I know I made it, man. I take care of that shed. I got my Whipper Snipper in there. I got my lawnmower. Happiness, yeah, man. And you know what, next year I'm gonna build a deck. I'm gonna sit on that deck and watch my children play in the yard. But you know what that guy never gets, and this is the real trick of dolls. That guy never gets a chance at the top of Maslow's hierarchy, never gets a chance at self actualization. Go on. Self actualization can only happen after everything else. And the trick that most people run into is they get so caught up trying to be who they need to be to survive, to feel okay that they can't get to that last step, and that last steps, I felt like self actualization. And most of our society, most of human history, it's been reserved for people like priests and kings, people who were supposed to revere the reason that we love all these all these actors and musicians and artists, because they're supposed to have it. They're supposed to have self actualization. But do they really? They they had it when they were 22 or 23 but maybe, you know, we got the 27 club right? A lot of people, like Jimi Hendrix, they all die when there he

Speaker 2  16:13  
has self actualization. Jim Carrey, he gave up on acting because he he knows himself. He knows what he likes? Yeah,

Speaker 1  16:21  
you got out of it Exactly, yeah. And there's, there's some of those, for sure, but you see this, you see these people who take a big pivot later on in life, yeah, they become a cartoonist, and they start drawing little cartoons, and they put them up on the internet, and they start making enough money off their cartoon hobby that they can maybe take a little break from work, right? They start working three days a week, or they get a shitty job that pays a little less because they want to focus on their hobby. Their hobby, and they've already got their house half paid for. They got a spouse that's got a better job in them anyways. So they focus on something that makes them happy, and they take care of the kids. Those people somewhat find self actualization, but what they haven't found is they haven't found a battle that they're willing to take on. They haven't gotten to live that battle their whole life with that actualization, with that power behind that feeling of knowing that every day of their life is dedicated to a purpose. Yeah, and this is why revolutions happen, because someday someone comes along and they say, Hey, what we're doing here is wrong. We need a new world. And you know, you know whose fault it is that we aren't living up. It's these guys. And they point at some people who've managed to amass wealth somehow, and they say, We should go take everything from them, and then that becomes the reason for self actualization. Yeah. It happened in the 1600s when they beheaded the royalty. It happened again in the 1900s when the communists kicked out a lot of the bourgeoisie, the rich people, as they were called. And it's happening again now with campaigns like eat the rich, yeah, going against these larger corporations. But what it does is it actually strips people of their own freedom, and it says you don't really have any hand in all this. You didn't have a choice. You just have to either hate it or live with it

Speaker 2  17:52  
because they can't do anything, because they don't have the means to do anything. Well, they don't think

Speaker 1  17:55  
they yet. They don't think they do. That's exactly because

Speaker 2  17:59  
that's what they're taught since that first bank account that they open, they think that they're just they're controlled, and they do not have the ability to control their own lives or anything that affects them.

Speaker 1  18:13  
Yeah, so, but the trick is, if you study the really great people, and maybe this is just how they have their biographies written, because they like to, they like to feel like they're the right guy, or they want everybody to believe that they're somehow the right person. But the trick is, actually most of their biographies are really humble. So Steve Jobs, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Jake Rivera, absolutely Fidel Castro, a lot of these guys, they actually started out quite humble, yeah. And actually, the one thing that they didn't do was they didn't get a lot of favors from other people. What they really did was they scraped it all together, and they kept their dedication to their purpose alive, and they didn't take on things that didn't lead towards that path.

Speaker 2  18:52  
When you have a will, you find a way. They didn't take

Speaker 1  18:55  
on commitments that didn't lead towards where they wanted to go, even athletes like Michael Jordan or Tom Brady. Same thing. They're really dedicated to one direction in their life, until they had such a handle on it that they could take on other things. And that's, yeah, a lot of athletes marry late, and a lot of great athletic careers actually, have actually been ruined by an early marriage to the wrong person, yeah, and it throws their game off. Yeah, they don't end up making it. Or even a lot of you know, like, there's the famous story of John Lennon and and what's her name? Yoko Ono, yeah. Broke up the Beatles, yeah. John Lennon cashed out to find happiness, and then ended up, kind of losing, losing touch with his audience. And Yoko Ono, come on stage screaming, crazy stuff. And the Beatles were like one of the greatest acts of all time. They were loved around Johnny Depp saying, Johnny Depp can sing, no,

Speaker 2  19:41  
his saying, his saying, What's saying. Never wanted to find the perfect woman, because as soon as he found the perfect woman, he would be content, and as soon as he's content, he's gonna stop going towards his goal, definitely

Speaker 1  19:53  
attacking his values. A consummate artist, yeah, yeah. There's a thing in acting called a method actor. So a method actor to get on is it comes from, like, a really ancient time, I think early, like kind of Renaissance era. And the concept of a method actor is you give up everything else in your life to fill the role, to fill the role with your whole heart and all of your energy, yeah, this is something that, like in Shakespearean times, was seen as, like this beautiful thing that you embody the character, because then the people you have to become the character, so that the people who are watching the performance can really feel, yeah, because for a moment, they can feel something that's completely outside of their own story. They can feel that they're part of a different story. Yes, you're there and you're in that story. And so you can bring them there with you,

Speaker 2  20:38  
the modern day actors. There's many of them like that, like Mr. Phoenix that did the Joker. He lost so much weight, he became the Joker every single day, so that it was almost like when he went on screen, it wasn't him changing his personality. He became that another one was, what was that actor's name that did Batman, The whatever you're thinking of, yeah, the guy that loses a bunch of weight for every role gains a bunch of weight, and he just, he completely becomes that role every time, I think. But in his personal life, he's kind of miserable.

Speaker 1  21:12  
They all are. That's yes I was gonna say, is, I think they all are. And I think the interesting thing there is, a lot of the early a lot of the big world changes have always been a little miserable, yeah? And that's because usually they're rebelling against something. Yeah, they're fighting back against a feeling they had of being wrong or the world not being the way that they thought it. They want something to change. They felt like, they felt like they're misplaced, yeah, world, and they want to, they want to make such a huge wave with their action that it changes things in a different direction. Yeah, every revolutionary, every great artist, every politician, every noteworthy Jackson

Speaker 2  21:48  
Pollock, even artists, honestly,

Speaker 1  21:51  
every really great mother and every really great friend also follow in this every moment of greatness and genius always comes in a contrarian fight against something that happened. Yeah, when we're really there for someone else, it's because we really care, and we want to make sure that the thing that pains us can for a moment be switched. Yeah, because we have that power to make the world slightly different for an instant. Yeah, for someone so the thing about this, that's crazy

Speaker 2  22:22  
is Robin Williams, living example. Robin Williams,

Speaker 1  22:25  
incredible example, absolutely. So the thing about this that I want to get at, though, is, throughout history, it's been very hard to be self actualized and have the rest of Maslow's hierarchy. To be self actualized is delusion. In all of these cases, there's no in mass was hierarchy. There's psychological needs which are sitting beneath safety, which support love and belonging, which support self esteem.

Speaker 2  22:52  
And if you and then act, and then they give everything up as soon as they do, those rules, for

Speaker 1  22:57  
many, it seems like they transcend to the top of the pyramid, and then in this moment of complete commitment, they have to give up all the things below in order to hold on to that image. And it's again, like, almost like a delusion after it, yeah, it's like, it's a an

Unknown Speaker  23:13  
attachment, almost

Speaker 2  23:14  
like an addiction. That's like them just seeing themselves as giving up their lives to for their goal. I don't think it's just actors. No, I'm saying like anyone else, like the revolutionaries. Do you think that it's them giving up their lives, letting go of everything else because they just want to do that goal, and it doesn't matter what else happens, they need to see the world change. So it's almost like they give up all these other things because they don't see enough value in that, and they just want to pursue that goal, because they don't care about themselves anymore. They don't care what happens. And as long as they change that goal, their life is complete. I

Speaker 1  23:49  
think there's two things that can happen when you reach self actualization. I think there's one way to get there, which is the cheap and dirty way, which gets you as close as you can to self actualization, just so that you can touch it and imagine it just for a second dirty way, the cheap and dirty way, is to do everything you have to to fill the rest of your needs so that you can get to that feeling of everybody respecting you and looking at you and saying that person is self actualized,

Unknown Speaker  24:12  
yeah, just for the look of it, just

Speaker 1  24:15  
no no, just to even feel like you got there yourself. Yeah, because everybody's been telling your whole life that you can get there, yeah. And you get to this thing that seems to be that, and everybody else looks at you and says, that looks like it. Are you feeling it? And you're like, Yeah, I guess so I'm here. Yeah, exactly. And then you spend a lot of time trying to stay there, and it's a lot of effort to stay there, and it's also, you're also probably trying to get other people in on your delusion, yeah, you're trying to get other people to also feel self actualized in this way that's very unique to you. And a lot of the The Lost elites tend to fall into this category. So whether it's whether it's great business minds on Wall Street who think they're running the world, but actually they're totally lost, and then they create a financial collapse, like 2008 Yeah, where they all agree that the world is fine, and then everything falls apart underneath them, or whether they're a bunch of political leaders in a country that drives itself into the ground where they all think that they're right and they're all making the right decisions, but they're totally lost. Or whether they're a bunch of actors in Hollywood who actually are doing horrible things and, yeah, living terrible lives where they treat everybody around them terribly, but no one will tell them they're wrong, yeah, whether you're any of those, you're wrong. And this is because self actualization means a continuous effort to maintain it. And the problem with that is it's very hard to maintain it. And so the thing, the thing, I think we should get back to the key purpose here, which is giving people the tools to elevate themselves. And so we talked about lumens. Yeah, so lumens are the the amount of light that comes off of a candle, yeah. And the unit of a lumen is the amount of light that comes off of a candle per second. And there's a graph of the amount of lumens per person in the world, and it corresponds to the literacy rate. It also corresponds to the productivity per person, and it corresponds to the intergenerational wealth in civilization, if you map it for each individual civilization over time, like introduction of technologies like oil lamps and then electricity, and then, you know, more modern things like phones and computers or even radios, are kind

Speaker 2  26:19  
of wealth relate? Does that relate as in their access and their power? Yeah? Because

Speaker 1  26:23  
this is, this is part of the theory. But the theory is effectively that you have genius and you have,

Unknown Speaker  26:31  
you have genius and you have

Unknown Speaker  26:38  
not savants, right? Savants?

Speaker 1  26:39  
Yeah, you have genius and you have savant, and a savant is to know, it's French, right? It's to understand and to know. And so there's people that, because of their perspective and their path, really, truly understand the world around them and have access to the right information throughout their life to be the right person, yeah, and genius is the physiological capability to grip reality and propel it forward, okay? And you have to have both of those things to really change the world,

Speaker 2  27:05  
right? Because you have to understand your surroundings while being able to move forward to actually make a change. So

Speaker 1  27:12  
you have to have a world that supports individuals, to support genius, so that genius can find knowledge, and so that each person can have their questions answered and have the right teacher, and that each person also asks the right questions so they can find their path. Yeah,

Speaker 2  27:29  
and I think that the what we discussed before with the banks and the credit and everything that is a way of suppression, and that's what we are trying to get away from. We're trying to free that, because I think that if we're able to relieve the stress, alleviate that, alleviate the working hours, and give people more time in every day, then people are gonna pursue their arts, their passions, more, and that's just gonna create so many more savants, so many more geniuses. But I think

Speaker 1  27:55  
the trick is, everybody is a genius in their own way. It's just a matter of at what, yeah, and the question is, they only have time, can they also become a savant at the thing that they're a genius at quickly enough in their life that they don't build up so many attachments to things that support their happiness?

Speaker 2  28:10  
I think Elon Musk, he talked about increasing the population to increase the amount of geniuses per capita. And I thought that was a smart idea, for sure. But if you think about it, if you think that every person has a certain level of genius, then freeing the people that we already have would increase it so much faster and so much greater.

Speaker 1  28:30  
There are already so many people, and all of them do genius things every day.

Speaker 2  28:35  
They do exactly and I think that's how he is losing his like I don't think, I think much of a savant anymore. I think

Speaker 1  28:42  
one of the big issues with the self actualization pyramid is that people have a hard time with the idea that they were lucky when they get to the top, because it was hard work. And it's always hard work. And it doesn't matter if you start as a rich person with a lot of access, or you start as a poor person who has no access. You still have to work hard. You still work hard every day of your life to get there, yeah, because it's your path, and you can never live up to your full expectations without giving up everything and doing all of the things every moment so that you can get there exactly, because that's what makes it your path. Yeah, you have to really hold on and do it, but you have to realize what it is first, exactly, yeah. But then the trick is, because of the way that this happens, many people who are currently on top and leading the world, they think that there are geniuses because they think that they are geniuses because it's the only way that they can understand why nobody else was able to do it exactly. But the trick is, everyone is able, yeah, we all have minds, and the question is, how quickly in our lives are we able to grip our own genius, and then are we able to ask the right questions, to find the right information, to understand how to act on our genius in a way that sustains our Basic everyday needs, covers our cost of living and contributes enough to society that it benefits others in a positive way, you know, so by extension, really interesting point only fans has actually created a whole bunch of geniuses they have, yeah, because there's a whole bunch of women out there and actually a bunch of random people doing other things now too, but there's a whole bunch of women out there who are making so much money off only fans that they're gonna be set for life, yeah, and some of them aren't gonna build up a bunch of bad habits with that money. And the ones who don't build up bad habits are going to be perpetual wealth magnates that help other people lift themselves up exactly and ethically. It sounds bad, but that's a tool that a lot of people can use to lift themselves out of poverty, just the same way that YouTube was a tool, or
