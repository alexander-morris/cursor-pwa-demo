Al Morris  0:00  
Okay, so the question in most people's lives is, do I want to do something that's just to cover my income, to make sure that I can pay my rent or maybe give me some extra spending money? Or do I want to do something that's so big that I can include tons of people around the world, and I can help them all do something, and I can make a little bit of money by building something really big and scalable? And so the trick is, once people get through, doing something for themselves that covers their bills, usually, the next step is to try to include other people. So the question, which I just asked, but I'll ask again, is, how many people do you want to help with this?

Speaker 1  0:35  
I want this is such a scalable business, and the reasoning behind it, as I am within the sales community on an E commerce site, I think that I would personally use this 100,000% if someone had already made it. And I think that every single person that posts on these sites, the fact that they would reach more buyers or sellers at decreased prices or sell their item faster. I think that every person that posts or buys online would see viability within this and would want to use this, and that would give us the funds to be able to make the changes that we really want to do.

Al Morris  1:11  
Got it? Yeah, I like the vision. It's an arbitrary tool that helps so many people, and by being part of this network, they get even more every time, because the network is all. Everybody in the network is developing the tool together, and it benefits everyone equally, to be part of this community, and not

Speaker 1  1:26  
just that, but also the buyers and sellers. Let's say someone just needs to sell an item. Let's say someone's just trying to start up their own business in their own community, and they don't even want to purchase the token itself. If they use our business, we would help them build their own business. It's a turnkey solution. It is a turnkey solution for so many facets all across just

Al Morris  1:46  
like opening a McDonald's franchise or starting an Amazon retailer, or starting a Shopify store, or starting to post your music on

Speaker 1  1:54  
SoundCloud, it's just that you can use $5 to start your business with us. Cool. Okay, so I wanna tie

Al Morris  1:59  
this back to one last piece, which we talked about Joe, the guy who Joey, who makes aquarium videos on YouTube, and how he's making $50,000 a month. And I think that's a really great example of how e commerce comes from passion as well. And I think there's also a big untapped market for this to help people sell themselves and sell their passion and to make passive income off of selling their passion, because at the end of the day, what people should focus on, what Joe what Joey should focus on, is his passion for aquariums and knowing the most and sharing the most and finding the best tips and tricks to make them as palatable for other people, to help as many people be as passionate as he is about aquariums. And if Joey can focus only on that, and his hustle bots can take care of the rest his hustle. Bots can figure out which products to sell. Which products have the best kill. He doesn't sell anything, YouTube ads sells them for him, right? He doesn't sell anything. He doesn't sell anything. He makes money off YouTube ads. Just YouTube ads, yeah, but YouTube ads is selling something, selling something else, yeah. But the thing that's cool, there's a lot of networks out there, like share sale, or Rakuten, or even like Facebook ads now has a conversion based thing, and these are called affiliate networks, yeah, and so they have is a commission on a product whenever you sell that product. EBay has that too, right? So you can get paid for driving ad impressions. But the best way to do it is actually to have your own store where you sell the products, right? So some of the only fans girls are doing this. Now, I heard that they're actually selling sex toys and lingerie, yeah, because the the husband or the boyfriend is watching only fans and seeing this chicken, this thing, he's like, I want my girl to have that exactly. And then he actually buys it from the store. And so they're actually a reseller for another full integrated marketing, or the manufacturers as well. They're a reseller for the manufacturer, or they've got some kind of an automated shipping thing. So when you buy something on their store, there's an automated fulfillment pipeline that purchases it at a lower price and no

Speaker 1  3:55  
interest, and that makes their own lingerie and stuff, and then they ship that out as well. So this would actually be able to help them pursue their passion as making your

Al Morris  4:04  
more broadly accessible product. Exactly. Yeah. So whether you're starting a business that sells a product, or you have an artistic profession that creates content, or you're trying to sell your art on SoundCloud or Spotify, or I'm selling someone's art right now, or you just have a passion that you're following. If you do anything that makes other people want to pay attention, we want you to focus on that, and we want to help you sell something in the process. And there's also ways where, like, we talked about a lot of the marketplace opportunities as well, where there's communities, like, there's people buying and selling things on eBay and these things are mispriced. There's Facebook marketplace, where there's tons of things that are mispriced, or there's like, you know, Facebook marketplace has this thing where in in some there might be a school that's out in a small town somewhere, like a university, and at the end of the university season, a lot of things are being sold in that area, like furniture and books and all that stuff. And maybe there's another community somewhere else where the shipping costs are less than the arbitrage difference. Or you could buy something in that university community, have it automatically shipped out to another location, and make a little bit of money by making sure it gets there on time. And that's incredibly powerful, because that benefits the seller who now has more liquidity in that university college town, and it benefits the buyer who got something at a good price in their community that they might not have been able to access.

Speaker 1  5:23  
So me and Trevor were talking about this earlier. He brought up a very good point that I barely had an answer for. He asked, How do we tap into the people that don't sell anything online? And my response to that was two fold. So the first response is, if our website gets big enough, and we have advertising and people can see the value in it, then they would be able to go in their own community by recognizing that, just like I did with coins and like these black girls, these will sell for at least one to $5 online, I can guarantee the guy that you bought these from does not sell them online. No, of course. So someone in this community might recognize that they might just look it up one day, and then they realize there's a market, and then we just got that untapped

Al Morris  6:06  
market, the whole global the whole global economy. And if you go back to like the early economics next, all of the economics thought leaders in the very early days of the field all talked about information asymmetry, because in the olden days, it was like you had to send a ship halfway around the world to buy tea for this price, and then you could resell it for 100 times the price. And that was how the whole economy functioned. That's why shipping was so valuable, because you could bring something that you got for nothing and sell it for much more, or you could bring something from one place that you got for one price, trade it for a thing in another place to get even more of that thing and come back. And so the ship would make money on both routes, and it would make like, 100 times on both directions, which is incredible. It's all about just filling needs, yeah? And it makes the world a better place, and it makes people happy, but a lot of that is things that can

Speaker 1  6:52  
also be automated, yeah? Or also, if we get large enough, then we can set up so many franchises for shipping facilities, where I know for a fact that if you ship enough products within a country, you can get the same thing that Canada has, which is a postal print so you would be able to rent one of those. And then if we have one in a community, and we set up shop next to a salary that's obviously doing well, then we would be able to ship all their products at a very decreased price, and ship all the packaging for it there at an insanely decreased price.

Al Morris  7:24  
So I think we can zoom out a little bit even more and say the two biggest, two of the biggest companies in the world are Amazon and Alibaba. Alibaba, founded by Jack Ma, who was an English teacher in China, yep, and Amazon, as we know, founded by Jeff Bezos. The thing that both of those two guys had in common was that they had computers and access to them, and they had groups of people around them who wanted to hustle, and they were able to take that small advantage and make global empires. And what we're talking about is giving anybody the opportunity to fulfill supply and demand needs by knowing the supply of things close to them and the demand for things in their community, and they become the person who is the logistics supply chain representative for their local area. And they get to run it like a franchise like McDonald's, where they're serving the local need, and they're relaying that local need back to the network. And when they post something, they say, We want tea in London, someone in China picks up the phone on the other side and says, I've got tea. What have you got? And then they swap it. No, no. But check us out. They can swap it without even exchanging much money. Yeah. And the guy who's got access to discount of tea in China can say, hey, well, the thing that everybody wants in China is they want those little, those little British phone booth key chains. And it sounds like you guys have a lot of those getting over there. And like, you know, they want the special ones from the doctor who show because it's really trending right now. And so we got this tea manufacturer who's going to buy little Doctor Who phone booths for tea. And so then these two people can do a swap, and they can retail to each other's audiences. And the one guy can find a whole bunch of buyers for a new tea brand out of China. He can go around every tea shop and every coffee shop in downtown London, and you can sign them all up to retail this new, amazing team. He can help with the branding, help with the design, give feedback on the customer needs, and the other guy can actually help find a market for some Knick Knack made in the UK, exactly. And both of these guys can help each other make a huge impact, yeah, and satisfy the needs of tons of customers. It would also

Speaker 1  9:18  
create so many jobs, because, let's say, if there was a commodity in a certain nation or country, and that commodity is something that can be produced or farmed, but there isn't much farming, there's only one person doing it. Then the person that finds that commodity and finds out it can be sold more online, they would be able to sell it. And if they saw it, a bunch of it, and they get enough money, then they would have to hire more people, which would bring employment to their hometown through that person, and then take more money away from these larger corporations that are doing it at a decreased price. Because this sounds like we would be able to do it at an even lesser price, as those corporations have different profit margins, and they're all no profit. But this gives everyone a competitive holding on the market. Does the centralizing effect? Yeah, exactly,

Al Morris  10:10  
fundamentally centralizing everything. But what everybody really wants is a good story, and they want to be part of a good story. So as much as I love buying things for cheap at Costco or on Amazon and having cheap, cheap, quick shipping delivery. What I really want is I want a product that matters, that has a story behind it, yeah, and I want to know that it came from a reliable network. And I want to know the truth about where it can. Want to be able to prove the story behind it exactly. There's a person on the ground in that place. I want to see a video of them receiving the goods. I want to hear the whole story about how this coffee was picked from this tree in this field, and how we took 5% of it and we gave it back to reforestation efforts to prevent the fire in the Amazon exactly

Speaker 1  10:48  
as well. They could also include like their company vision or their company values and what they're doing with their company and even if it was at like the same price, let's say we could get something that Costco sells at the exact same price, sold online, or even a little bit more, people would buy it at a little bit more, as long as they know it's going to a

Al Morris  11:10  
good cause, as long as the margin is going to local people as well. Exactly That's what I'm talking about. Margin goes back to a bunch of shareholders on Wall Street, yeah. And so Costco is charging a profit margin on everything that they sell you. And it might not be a big profit margin, but it's a market. It's still a margin, and they're not paying their employees as well as they could be, and they're not giving them the best health insurance. But if you fund a whole bunch of entrepreneurs, entrepreneur, by the way, in French, entrepreneur means entre, no, the person who takes things between, yeah, this is the definition of entrepreneurship, and it's something that you can automate. You can start by just putting up a little bit of money and automating it. Yeah. You can start by being a delivery driver. You can start by being a logistics provider who has packaging in their front room of their house. You can start by just, you can start

Speaker 1  11:53  
with $5 with us on what we're trying to build, and then after you start making money with that, you can do what might be local, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think we're giving a lot of people ability Exactly. Yeah,

Al Morris  12:05  
exactly. And I think that the trick with this is maybe you don't have a passion for fish tanks, or maybe you don't have a passion that you know of, that you can make content about, so maybe you're left out of the Internet right now, which is a lot of people, a lot of people are not high enough up on the Maslow's hierarchy to know what their passion is, because they're still worried about survival. But if you're still worried about survival and you have a phone, there's an app you can install, and it helps you make just a little bit by filling the gaps in the global economy, and helps you navigate that landscape to find the opportunity that matches to what you can offer where you are without changing who you are. And if you have more to offer, if you have an account, if you have a storefront, if you have friends that have certain products, if you have access, if you have a car, if you have a living room where you can package things, whatever it is that you have, we will help you identify that, and we will help you bring it to the table, and we will help you fit it into this world, and then we'll help other people to use what you're putting out on the table, and we'll help make sure that both of you have a fair price throughout

Speaker 1  13:07  
the whole process. So I've known, I think, that the website that I'm trying to build for myself, there should be a line where you can enter in the commodity and it shows you the general fair market value that you that is sold for. So let's say commodity, the shipping price, the logistics like, the profit margin per or price that it sells for, and with everything included.

Al Morris  13:29  
But you can, you can localize that to every part of the supply chain as well, exactly.

Speaker 1  13:33  
So what I'm saying is that if we had just like a toolbar that's looking at the fair market value for every site, what it generally sells for, and shows them what their actual cost is per item after everything's included. Then they would be able to look through their community, find something that's farmed or created, and they would just enter that into that and see the price of it. If their price in their community is less than they have a business,

Al Morris  14:00  
they they can identify their opportunities more quickly,

Unknown Speaker  14:04  
more quickly. So the the when they first open

Al Morris  14:07  
the app, the first thing it does is it begins to identify things about them. It says, Do you want to share your location? This will help us to find opportunities near you, exactly you share your location. And it says, okay, based on where you live, these are the kind of things that might be really great opportunities for you, like Netherlands and coins. Are any of these interesting to you right now?

Unknown Speaker  14:29  
Or even ask what they're interested if they say

Al Morris  14:32  
no, then it's like, Okay, are there any really thriving businesses nearby you? We searched the web and we found these five types of businesses that seem to be doing well in your area, yeah. What about these? And then you can say no again, yeah. And then it'll say something like, Okay, well, because of where you live, there are some things that are common advantages. One of them is, you know, you live in a very busy shipping port. In other words, the region you live in has really amazing artistic culture. And another one is, you know, because of where you live, you speak this language, which means that these three or four countries are really accessible for you where they might not be for some of our existing network, and we're trying to move into this community. So we could really use you to help us bridge the gap as

Speaker 1  15:20  
well. Could also do that in countries where we already are, or spaces where we already are, and say, Would you consider employment at this location if we had, like, a shipping center there? So if they don't have anything that they're interested in, it would also provide that. And maybe they could submit a resume and also help us grow further. Yeah, you can find

Al Morris  15:41  
the you can find the right people. The option is like, hey, so you know, if you don't know what you're looking for right now and you want to just meet some people who are really smart about this, there's a meet up every Thursday at this location exactly, and you can go and meet local people interested in this too. And if you don't have time on Thursday, it's okay. We'll put you in this group so that you can chat with them and you can ask questions.

Speaker 1  16:02  
As wallet could also provide tips for doing some outreach, like, because a lot of people are very self conscious and they don't know how to do outreach because, which is something that I know how to do really well, but they would be able to just go to local providers. It would give them tips, like, go to your market. These are markets around you that you could go and check out items. You could find local creators that you could sell this for, right? And it could even be like, give them tips how to be commissioned salesmen. So let's say they don't have the capital to buy that item in their area, but they it would give them tips. Say, Go to this person, ask them if you can sell it online, and you would make one to 3% of that sale just for that person.

Al Morris  16:42  
Definitely, actually. The other option too is like, if they really don't know what they're looking for, what you can do is you can ask them what they're interested in, and then the agent can recommend occasional videos. Would you like to sign up to have a recommendation every couple days to help you start your learning career? Yeah, we can. We can start to give you some insights, and if you don't like them, we'll try to find different stuff you might be interested in. That's true. Everything that we will share with you has been vetted by our community, and people have found it useful to help them lift themselves up.

Speaker 1  17:13  
Yeah, as well. With that, there's probably, like, there's gonna be some kind of analytic I know that there would be, I don't know how it would work, but let's say someone's interested in fish tanks. Why are they interested in fish? Are they interested in building? If they're interested in building, have you thought about carpentry? Have you thought about woodland? Have you thought about these things? Are you interested in fish? What kind of fish you're interested in this kind why? This is really cool. Yeah.

Al Morris  17:40  
So the thing that I really I started doing this a little while ago with the large language models. They're all copying Google right now. Yeah. So Google, the way Google works is you ask it for something and then it gives you options. Yeah, right. And it's to be better by checking which option you pick when it asks you for something. What I think the the AI of the future will do is it will ask you questions to better understand you, and then when you give it information, it will research, using that information to try to understand what you're saying and try to come up with something that's helpful to help you develop what you're thinking about next. Yeah,

Speaker 1  18:16  
almost like giving suggestions for your own progression before you think

Al Morris  18:19  
of it. Exactly. So we're doing here is doing that just really specifically honing in on the personal economic access angle. Avi wants to do this in a different direction, which he calls Sophia. So he's been building a platform for like five years called insightful. Okay, Sophia is the goddess of wisdom, and so he wants to do this. Originally started out for him as a project that was about mental health. So he wanted to build an AI therapist. I really like that they would ask you questions and help you understand yourself, so that you could develop a sense of understanding of your own perspective, and just ask you questions to check the contradictions in your logic. Yeah. And so there's a, there's an element of that here, but I think we have to focus on a network based on value creation, because if it's based on value creation, then there's a reason for me to be there. And I don't feel

Speaker 2  19:14  
I don't feel awkward about the experience. I'm not the experience of value creation. It's

Al Morris  19:19  
not a self help thing. I'm not there because I'm like, not good enough and I'm trying to be better. I'm there because I want this, AI to help me make money. Yeah,

Speaker 1  19:27  
right. But that's also by finding your passion, or finding even if your passion is just sales, then it would I think that this is a, an amazing idea. Honestly, this is, this is like the next evolution of what we want to do. Okay?

Al Morris  19:42  
So wait, there might be an even easier way to do this. Yeah, I think step one of this might be to make a really shitty app and get it on the App Store, maybe even skip the app store and get it to one of those, like add to home screen apps, or even just a website that people go to, okay? And basically what you do is you go to this website and it asks you a question in your native language based on your geolocation,

Unknown Speaker  20:09  
that you can obviously change anyone it just

Unknown Speaker  20:11  
fucking talks to you, man,

Speaker 1  20:12  
yeah. Well, don't they already have that as like the AI boyfriends and girlfriends and

Al Morris  20:17  
shit. Yeah. Well, Google Gemini is open source, okay, Google Gemini. We can just take Gemini, which I actually did it yesterday, the first version, yeah, I didn't show you this yet. I made the first version of an AI chat bot using Google Gemini. That's awesome. Just a website that talks to Gemini. And so when you send it a message, it goes and it creates an insight, and it asks you,

Unknown Speaker  20:36  
passion finder,

Unknown Speaker  20:39  
name of that? Name of the app, I just call it hustle

Speaker 1  20:41  
bot. No. I mean, like the app that helps you find your passion, to help you find out what you're actually doing. Like thing that asks you questions, helps you learn about the creativity, find out why you want to do those. Then give you suggestions when you find once you find those, it just keeps helping you define it. So find out what you actually

Al Morris  20:58  
love. There's an issue with the branding there. Yeah, just like, passion is kind of gay man. That's true. I don't admit that. I'm like, looking for my passion, you know? I mean,

Speaker 1  21:08  
that's that's before self actualization, isn't it? I

Speaker 2  21:11  
want the app on my phone that just makes me $200 a week, okay?

Speaker 1  21:15  
I think I'm like, diverting into a different kind of idea, rather than feels. I think we can

Al Morris  21:20  
slip in, yeah, the passion finding, okay, no. I mean, because, like, pretty much everybody would go for an extra $1,000 a month, goal finder. No, I think this. These are all like, sub things that happen, yeah, we call this storyboarding, which is like, basically, you get the app, and then what happens. So the thing that can happen is you get the app, you find a way to make money, and it helps you identify little things that you can do that would benefit you financially. It basically no, it's a massive hierarchy builder, right? True Talent. I'm getting hustle bot, but just hustle

Speaker 1  21:58  
bot, yeah, I think that this should be something called something different, because hustle bots are just for sales.

Al Morris  22:04  
No, but I think of it this way, the hustle bot also helps you, if you're an artist, because I'm an artist, I'm trying to like, make art my career. Yeah, whatever your career is going to be in the future. Oh, if you already know

Speaker 1  22:13  
your talent, then you're just art, and then you use the hustle bot. What I'm saying is we need to help people figure out what they're gonna do, what they actually like to make money? Yeah. So whatever

Al Morris  22:24  
it is, it's still gonna be a side hustle until it's your full hustle. And everybody actually whatever you want is they want their hustle to be something they really love. That's

Speaker 1  22:32  
why I think this is like a sub category on the front page. If you don't know what you're gonna make money with, this is the thing that's gonna help you find the money. And I think that bot should be called something else, and then hustle bots are like thing that

Al Morris  22:46  
makes money. Can we do this? Yeah, the app is the same no matter what you call it, okay, it just has a slightly different language, okay. Website looks a little tiny bit different, yeah. So what we can do actually, is we build it once, which is probably gonna take us, like three or four weeks, okay, and then we run some ads. Can we AB test five different versions, or, like, three or four different versions of it with different branding? AB tests. AB test it. So the way AB testing works? Yeah, we run a campaign with one version of the language at the same time. We run another campaign with a different version of language, and we do, like several of them in parallel. Okay, so there's like, four different versions of the app, four different versions of the website. Because the thing is, once you have it, changing the language and changing the colors and stuff is really easy, yeah, right, because it's just, you're just changing little bits. So the thing is, we can run four different campaigns for this in parallel to try the thing works. And we can also see which people in which parts of the world resonate with which versions of it. We could

Speaker 1  23:45  
also pay people in those regions, in like the token, to help us to find the market. They could tell us something about that. If we use that, and it turns out that's actually a better marketing technique or things business, then we can pay them

Al Morris  23:57  
exactly. So what I'm getting at here is in the corner, yeah, as you answer questions and build up your profile, yeah, it's just got this little ticker that's counting up. And if you tap on it, it's like, these are your hustle points. These are your these are your passion points. These are your true talent points, passions getting these are your Dallas points. But yeah, right. So these are your points, right? Yeah. And when the network goes live in three months, these are gonna turn into actual money, and you can spend this money to launch your side hustle using AI, yeah. And so then everybody's like, I want to get as many as possible. So they talk to this fucking thing all day, yeah. And what we end up with is a bunch of usage stats that are going through roof and data. And we get a ton of data on a bunch of actual people, and we have all their email addresses, and they all keep the app installed because they got to keep the app installed to keep their points. Yeah, if they uninstall the app, they lose their points. And if this goes viral, we can have, like, a refer a friend. Thing. You get one invite. Yeah, each person gets one invite, okay, right? For every 10 questions or something, yeah. And when you invite somebody, they get 10 free hustle points. And so do you,

Speaker 1  25:04  
and you get a hustle point for the creation on every e commerce site too. Yeah, yeah, that's a great idea. So

Al Morris  25:12  
then the entry point is this app that asks you a bunch of questions and gets to know you a little bit. Yeah? And then from there, we can also market to this community. Yeah, true. You were really interested in ai e commerce. How would you like an eBay app? Yeah. And once check us out, once we have 100,000 people who signed up and said they wanted an eBay app, eBay would pay us, no, not even eBay, but like an investor will give us a million dollars to build them all an app, because we just go to an investment. We're like, we have 100,000 we could actually, like, build an app and then market that. We have 100,000 actual people. You market it and then you build it in like, two weeks. Yeah, right. We have 100,000 actual people who wanted to trade $100 on eBay. Yeah, we think we can take a 5% margin

Unknown Speaker  25:54  
so we could have our own e commerce site

Al Morris  25:56  
the recurring revenue on that existing group of 100,000 people. Yeah? Is like $25,000 per week, right? So, yeah, some people give us a million dollars immediately to fund that. I know hundreds of people have just give us the money for it. So the cool thing, though, is, if we have this group of people that have the hustle bot, initial app installed, profiling, we build up all of these profiles using AI. We don't even actually have to figure it out ourselves. We just gather all this data. The AI is asking them questions, right? Yeah, we got a group of people that all want to launch music videos. They all want to make music videos for a living, yeah? So then we ask them, Hey, do you want to sign up for our new music video generating we

Speaker 1  26:34  
basically have access to if this launches and does well. We have access to such an insane amount of people, and we pay them to download these things, and that could lead to us making our own e commerce site or our own Facebook or our own YouTube.

Al Morris  26:50  
The trick is being the closest to the consumer. Yeah, exactly. So the best we talked about moats earlier. Moats are like the thing that prevents somebody from stealing your idea. So the best mode you can leave that recording, by the way, while you do other things in your phone. Oh yeah, you can just change the app. The best mode is consumer trust.

Speaker 2  27:11  
So that's what Apple has, right? It's what Google has. It's what

Al Morris  27:19  
it's what the Incognito Mode on Google Chrome has right? It's consumer trust. Is that feeling that I can trust that this is, this is working as expected, right? If we do this correctly, we have the largest database of hustlers in the world. Yeah?

Speaker 1  27:37  
And they would be so willing to work if we gave them a task.

Al Morris  27:41  
Yeah. And this is like, this is the community that Elon Musk wants to revolutionize the US, and it's the community that Putin wants to take Russia into the next generation, true, the community that Xi Jinping wants to build the China that will dominate the world and space. It's the community in each country of the most diligent, hard working people. So when we ask people to refer a friend, we say, hey, send this. You get one invitation. You've earned an invitation. You've earned one, just one invitation. Send this to the hardest, craziest, most inspiring person you know, because we want them in this amazing community.

Speaker 1  28:23  
And then we could also add, if that person gets to a certain amount of hustle points, we will pay you a percentage of that hustle point or give them more, because that will make them refer someone that's actually really good. I think

Speaker 2  28:35  
you can kind of, there's ways we can tweak it and test it, and

Speaker 1  28:40  
I'm saying just so they refer someone good, rather than just refer one person. That sucks, of course, yes. I

Al Morris  28:45  
think the trick is you want to always double check the language on things like that so it doesn't look too scammy. Oh, yeah. Sent the referral codes on coil. A little scamming. Yeah. So it sketches people out. When you say, like, send this to the best person, you know. Man, no.

Speaker 1  28:58  
I'm saying, if this referral generates at least this amount of hustle points, then we will pay you this amount of hustle points, right? And they already are using the hustle point system, so they realize how much work that has to do, so they're not going to refer someone that's bad. And I think language, that's the idea behind that, yeah, make note of that order. Do you know about

Al Morris  29:18  
clubhouse? Clubhouse? It was this. It was like a talk radio app. Clubhouse ballooned to a billion dollar valuation, and now it's completely

Unknown Speaker  29:28  
gone. Oh shit, yeah. What happened? What was it?

Al Morris  29:31  
It got beaten by Twitter spaces. Okay, so the way clubhouse did it, they got, like, all the top pop numbers and all the big a list celebrities and all that stuff. They got them all onto the same app, and people would come to listen to them. People would come to listen to people on clubhouse, because all the a list celebrities and stuff were on it. And so people would come to go on clubhouse to talk about whatever they were into at that moment. Because, like, if you know if Jay Z was launching a new record label, or like, So and so was doing a thing that was going to happen in a certain way, then they would want to get lots of eyeballs from the clubhouse community, because those people were, like, also really high end elite people. So what clubhouse did to get started, though, is that they went and they got a bunch of like, a list people to commit to being a part of the network. Okay? By giving

Unknown Speaker  30:24  
them equity, by just giving it to

Al Morris  30:26  
them, they just gave them equity. They're like, hey, you know, we'd really like you to be an advisor on this thing. We think it's going to blow up. It's going to change the world. We're going to get this community of people. It's going to be really inspiring, and you're going to be at the center of it. So it's going to really help cement your reputation. Yeah, and what they traded names, so they got some of their, like, close connections, who weren't real big people, who then were on the list. So then when they went to those people's connections, and they got slightly bigger people, and they went up the food chain. And, you know, we're only each like, five degrees of separation from Elon Musk, yeah, literally, whoever, right, dog, whatever. So they went up the food chain enough that they got into like the B list celebrities, okay? And then they launched the thing, and they gave everybody who was in it one invite code every time that they spoke publicly on The Talk Radio thing, really, you had to actually talk in order to get an invite code. So all these people at the bottom of the group all wanted to be in, and they made a wait list, and you had to sign up by email to get in. Okay, so then people who were on the wait list felt really excited that they got to go in and listen to what all these A listers were talking about. All the A listers knew this was an exclusive group of people, so they wanted to actually show their latest thing. So they would take the time to spend 30 minutes. Yeah, they went to all the PR agencies, and they said, Hey, if you really want to, like, get good placement. We have this great, really elite community of people that you can talk to. You should probably be talking on here at least once a month to really cement your name and be a part of this community from day one. And then they did lines on like Forbes and stuff, where they spent the 50 grand to get Forbes to profile the top 50 things that happened on clubhouse this week, and nobody else could get in no before check us out. The wait list was like millions of people, yeah. And like people in Halifax, Nova Scotia were on the wait list that I knew who were complaining about being on the wait list. That's insane. And meanwhile, Forbes and the New York Times and everybody were publishing stories about the top 20 clubhouse things that you missed this week. Here's the notes from what Elon Musk said to Jay Z, go ahead. What are you talking about?

Speaker 1  32:20  
Oh, I was just gonna say, if we have that network, we also know what they're doing, and if we find two people that can collaborate, we can connect them,

Speaker 2  32:27  
oh, yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 1  32:31  
And if we also have manufacturers that are working and it's like their kind of product, or we know that kind of manufacturing, could also do another kind of manufacturing, we could also connect them to people that could provide the resources cheaper, that are already selling on the network,

Al Morris  32:44  
absolutely. So the trick is, when somebody comes into this thing, right, they start answering your questions, and it's like, hey, hustle bot is blank. Hustle bot is the biggest community of the biggest people around the world. Yeah, our mission is to help everybody get a piece of the future Mars. What you can contribute humanity is going to be on Mars in the next five years. Yeah, the world is changing every day. AI and robotics are about to reshape the economy. We want all of you to have a piece of it. We're building large corporations to keep control here. We're building a big AI that's owned by little people and big people alike. Yeah, and we want the best minds as part of it, the following five questions will determine whether or not you get one of the first seats on the bus. Yeah, true. First question.

Unknown Speaker  33:37  
First question for me, what's

Al Morris  33:38  
the first what was the first question you should ask? It's gonna feel exclusive yet also inclusive. It's like passionate and remember, this is an AI that's talking to you out loud in your own language. So it doesn't matter where you're in the world, it's speaking to you. What do you want

Speaker 1  33:55  
most for humanity? That's a cool one. Yeah, because people could say progression, people could say and world hunger, and that's gonna generate the next you say

Al Morris  34:04  
something slightly different. What do you hope for most in the future? Yeah. And then if they say something that benefits humanity, that puts them in one direction, if they

Unknown Speaker  34:12  
say like, or to see in the next five years, yeah,

Al Morris  34:15  
if they exactly yeah, what is the thing that you hope to see the most? And like, some of them might just say, like, I just really want my family to be okay, right? Yeah. And you know, that's gonna show big

Unknown Speaker  34:25  
value there, right?

Al Morris  34:26  
But based on the first question, we can also ask them another second question. So if they say something like, I just, I just want my family to be okay, right? Yeah. Then next, the next question can be like, how hard is that to achieve? And what are you prepared to do to make that real? And then they can tell us their story, right? And all of these answers get logged into the public thing, not the public. It's not out in public, but it's in the Data database, yeah. And so then we can actually get the AI to select the thing that's going to be the best, the best fit, the people who are the best fit. But the cool thing is, then everybody who answers the first five questions for at least the first couple months,

Speaker 1  35:04  
what do you do for fun? Is another one interest that's gonna show something about their passion? Yeah,

Al Morris  35:09  
what is something that you do for fun? Or what some would love to share with other people that you do love to share with other people? I don't

Speaker 1  35:17  
think that's that's gonna, like, stifle it a little bit, because if you ask them what they do for fun, but if they don't want to share that with other people, and they don't think that's something, like, maybe,

Al Morris  35:29  
yeah, they're insecure about it, yeah. So we can, we'll have to workshop the questions over Yeah. The trick is, we're gonna take the first, like, 500 responses, yeah, and we're gonna catalog them and do something with them, to try to understand them, but develop it more evolve. But the trick is that this is a system that, like, basically, as we get more eyeballs on it, we can improve the questions, but every person that responds to the questions feels like they exposed themselves to this broader thing that's happening. They were honest and they connected, and they they had a moment of intimacy, and then, yeah, because of that moment of intimacy, then they were chosen, and because of that thing that, because they were chosen, then they get to have this every day or two, another question pops up, and they get to answer it, because we can do the notifications thing right. It's like pop, and we're not gonna send we're not gonna send too many notifications. Every couple days, you'll have a chance to answer another question to help connect you better to other people in the network. Our goal is that by about two weeks from now, we'll be ready to help you find a way to get a side hustle going, run by AI that's gonna help you make passive income just by being you. Another side

Speaker 1  36:44  
note is that, let's say we go back to that question that I asked, What do you do for fun? Let's say someone says they like to play piano. So we can't really make money off that realistically, but we would be able to make money in a different way. So what you like to play piano? And then we ask, how do you learn to play piano? And we should also add a compliment with a lot of these questions, like

Unknown Speaker  37:08  
to play piano? Wow, that's super cool. But

Speaker 1  37:10  
then we could advertise people, right? And we could say, Oh, you like to play piano. Here's a great way to learn piano. We're gonna send you this channel or this other thing. And then every person that we send, the more views that we send. You get paid by that person that's gaining from them. Yeah,

Al Morris  37:26  
there could be, actually, have you ever heard of these brands? Because we actually want to know is, we want to know who's a tastemaker, right? A tastemaker, a tastemaker. So if the only, if the only yoga person you ever heard of is Yoga with Adriene, which is like one of the most popular yoga video instructors on YouTube, okay? Like, at one point during COVID, everybody in my company was, we were all watching Yoga with Adriene, and we didn't even know it. And then one person brought it up on a group call, and we're all like, Ha, yeah, funny as we all went on YouTube, searched yoga and watched Yoga with Adriene, yeah. And so what that actually means is none of us have any value as a taste maker, because we're all watching the same thing. Your taste in something, well, helping our community find the next thing. So Joey, who is the fish tank guy? Yeah, the thing about Joey is, Joey probably finds a bunch of niche sources of information. Yeah. So, like, one of the questions could be, where do you get the best information about that? If it's your passion, where do you get the no heat? No. But this what I mean, it's like, yeah, if it's your passion, where do you get the best information about it? Yeah. So there's usually like, Okay, well, I have this store that I go to where there's a really knowledgeable shopkeeper and I ask him questions. And then I have this friend online that I talk to sometimes about it. And then I have this one guy that's been making amazing videos for ages. And whenever I watch one of his videos, I watch to see who comments on them, and then I go check out their latest videos, because some of them are really cool and they're up and coming.

Speaker 1  38:47  
Yeah, that money? You say that because he's literally done all that. Joey's main passion, king of DIY. It was for that initial goal. But he never wanted to make money. He wanted to show people how to do these things. He says he's actually like, he's an innovator, so he doesn't really do a lot to learn about it anymore, but what he's doing now is he flies everywhere just to host conferences, to teach people about this and connect more people within that community with each other. Can I give

Al Morris  39:16  
an example of something I'd really like to have in this community? Yep. So there's this guy that I've been following on YouTube, no on Instagram for a while. And he he makes, well, he started out making Iron Man armor, okay? He wanted to build his own Iron Man suit. That's cool. So this guy legitimately built a bunch of the pieces of an Iron Man suit, yeah, and then put them together his garage. That's awesome, right? And then he got to the end of that project. And he was like, I don't know what I'm gonna do next. And he posted some videos going, I don't know what I'm gonna do next. And then after like, a little while, he ended up building a reactor in his backyard that converts plastic into fuel. What that, like, powers a small generator. And then now he's making videos about that. And then now he also does like, he also researches all these other random science things on the internet talks about those, right? And so this guy that I originally followed for this one reason, because he was like a super niche hobbyist who just really passionate also happens to bring me other interesting insights, right? Yeah, and there's a lot of those people out there, and if they're all part of the network, and they're all teaching this communal intelligence thing that we have, and we match make them with each other, because there might be somebody out there who's like a master marketing, sales guy, and if you connect him with that genius tech mind, or

Speaker 1  40:28  
if he I connect with him too, because I feel like that's my passion, and he would teach me so much, right? And then I would be able to take that knowledge and then progress further right at a faster rate. Do you know who

Unknown Speaker  40:39  
Mr. Beast is Mr.

Speaker 1  40:41  
Beast. Mr. Beast. Um, I know that name. I know who that. Oh, yeah, Mr. Beast, the YouTuber that doesn't take profit. He just gives it all wet. One

Al Morris  40:51  
of the top YouTuber guys the top he was, like, probably the first real sensation on YouTube. And he's, yeah, when he did it, yeah. But the thing is, he's just a savant for, like, tuning the thumbnails and getting his videos out there on Reddit and all the other places, and he writes the thumbnail right, and he gets the title right, and he makes content that people want to watch all the way through. And so the algorithm loves this guy, yeah. And then he also figured out how to make videos about things that are gonna sell on ad clicks, yeah. So he gets huge engagement. He gets a lot of shares, and he makes videos about things that sell a lot of ads, and so Google makes a ton of money off of Mr. Beast entertaining. So he basically turned himself into the new Bill Nye, the Science Guy, or the new Mythbusters. And people

Speaker 1  41:31  
love watching him because they see his videos, and he's literally just giving a lot of weight to people, but he's

Al Morris  41:36  
self elected himself. He just decided he was going to be a sensation. Exactly because of this, YouTube is probably making like, hundreds of millions a year off of Mr. Beast content because of the ad value, which means Mr. Beast makes all this money, which means he gets to reinvest it in making better content, yeah, and the platform benefits and more research too. But the reason I brought up Mr. Beast is there's people who are savants at communicating like that, and what they love most of all is they love finding talented people to help them spread their dream, too, yeah, especially once they've made it like Mr. Beast has. So if you create a network of hustlers like this, it might not be Mr. Beast, but somebody with that talent tree, that's that skill set, yeah, could help one person every month. That's just, just one of these people from the hustler network every month could get connected with this incredible content, become mentors. And then that content group probably has some people who are his mentees, yeah, his like students, his disciples, who he's selected because they have an aptitude for it, who work with him and who want to learn from him. And those people want someone to work with to produce incredible content. So then every hustler gets a content person who's also a hustler, yeah, and then there's also probably out there somewhere a sales guy or a marketing guy or a trader who also wants to work with people like that. And so now you've got a team of these people,

Speaker 1  42:51  
or like artists, and they're teaching people how to paint in a certain way better. Every

Al Morris  42:54  
artist needs an art sales guy. Picasso's brother was an art dealer. Or every musician needs a producer.

Every musician needs a producer, right? Yeah, there's no, there's no rap industry without a bunch of people.

Speaker 1  43:18  
There are so many people that have so much potential to be a producer or anything like that, they just don't have the means to start. That was another thing I was gonna bring up there. My little brother has been trying to be a famous artist, a musician, for about eight years straight. Now he's spent a lot of money on that, and he does not work. He's being unemployed for eight months straight. Wow, right now, just because he wanted to do his passion, he used to be. He refuses to be a teacher, even though he is better than any teacher I've ever met, just because he wants to do that and his music, he wants to be a famous musician, amazing. And it's not about being rich for him or anything. He just really enjoys making music. And all this music is just about, like, it's just about loving yourself honestly. Ah, yeah. Wait,

Al Morris  44:06  
I have a huge insight, yeah. So we talked earlier about how artists sometimes skip the levels of Maslow's hierarchy, but they kind of like fake them so they can get to the part where they self actualize. And I think the thing that's exciting about that is that maybe the reason they can do that is because they they actually get the feeling of safety and security. They get the feeling of love. They get the feeling of comfort and the feeling of well, they get the whole Maslow's hierarchy basically out of producing amazing art. So when they listen to their own song or look at their own painting. They have that feeling of comfort. They have that feeling like someone has when they look at their newborn baby or when they hold their dog,

Unknown Speaker  44:54  
kind of like I do with the bills. Yeah,

Al Morris  44:55  
when collectors are like this too, for sure, or like the way that I feel, I feel this incredible pride when I see the people that work with us launch their latest thing like I see people come in and they work really hard, and then they grow and they're able to do something big. And I feel the same way that I would, I think if I had kids, yeah, right. It's for the same kind of pride, right? This is like your kid, yeah. I think you can have your muscles hierarchy, substituted in different ways, by mentoring people, by creating incredible things. And you can have, especially with music, though, you can have that it's like a synthetic emotional experience, yeah, and I bet for method actors, it probably works the same way. I bet when Johnny Depp is Captain Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean, I bet that Johnny Depp is actually a mad man obsessed with rum who wants to live on a boat for the rest of his life. And I bet he lives as that man for months, absolutely. And he probably enjoys being that man more than he enjoys being himself. It's probably the most satisfying possible option. 100% that's kind of incredible, right?

Speaker 1  46:01  
The reverse where, like, let's say with the Joker, where the Joker had mental instability. Do you think Jacqueline Phoenix

Unknown Speaker  46:07  
or whatever ledger,

Speaker 1  46:10  
Lacon Phoenix also not Heath Ledger. I'm talking about Phoenix on Phoenix. What con Phoenix also probably went through it? Well, I'm saying like, do you think that there was a chance that he might have actually developed the same kind of mental trauma or mental illnesses that the Joker would have had because he met the

Speaker 2  46:27  
doctor, committed suicide. I do after being the Joker in Batman,

Unknown Speaker  46:31  
yeah, which is

Speaker 2  46:35  
after, after being the Joker, though. And I think that's actually a common thing for actors, right? Yeah,

Speaker 1  46:39  
this point. I think that's why the actual Batman, like the Batman from that same movie. I can't remember the name of the guy for the life me, but he looks miserable every day. He's divorced now,

Speaker 2  46:52  
but I think they also probably, when they were doing it, they felt really committed to the art,

Speaker 1  46:58  
yeah, but then that makes them lose their true identity. That's what I was saying. With people losing that as soon as they dedicate themselves to that top tier,

Al Morris  47:09  
I think it's possible that they still care more about the dedication than they do about getting to keep being themselves. Yeah, so it's still worth it for them to follow the art. I think another one like that is Kevin Spacey? Yeah, Kevin Spacey has been so many bad guys.

Speaker 2  47:29  
He's been so many bad guys that he might even have become a bad guy. Yeah? So, like

Unknown Speaker  47:36  
he was like, Oh, Kevin Spacey is like a monster now, yeah,

Al Morris  47:39  
American Beauty. He was the house of cards guy. He was Kaiser Sosa. He's murdered someone in real life. He's been so many distinctly evil people. Yeah, you got to imagine that at some point that starts to hurt your resolve to be a good person, absolutely and so that eventually impede your confidence in yourself.

Speaker 1  47:57  
Exactly. That's why the with the self actualization and what the true goal is. I think that it needs to be like a true value in something that is worthwhile in that sense. Because if not, then it's going to make you into a different person, and that's going to change you, where who you are

Al Morris  48:16  
as a person. Okay, so this, again, this brings us back to the hierarchy and the way that people should come into this culture that we're building. Also, let's do this for five more minutes. Yeah? Okay, so five minute warning, I'm gonna set a timer. Actually do it like chess. We have two and a half minutes for a final statement each. Yeah? So I'll kick off the final statement because I've actually been wanting to get to that one. The way that I'm gonna kick off the final statement on my end is with an ancient Greek concepts called logos, pathos and ethos. So this is how the ancient Greeks structured philosophy. This was taught to me by a very, very good friend of mine. The idea is, Logos is logic. So you have to have logos pathos and ethos in order to function as a person. So logos is logic. So you have to have some logic in what you say, or other people will reject your words. They simply won't listen to you. You have to have pathos, which is the desire, the pathology, the psychology, the you have to have an emotional connection to what you're saying. And then you have to have ethos, which is an empathetic understanding of the other person's needs. So you have logic about where you want to go, you have pathos of why you want to go there, and you have ethos of what other people will feel if they come on this journey with you. And I think the important thing about this is you have to help people through many stages of this evolution. So they have to start out doing this selfishly, to help themselves further, to help them with a problem they have, or to make some passive income, or for whatever reason that they do it, to do it selfishly, perhaps even just loneliness. And they have to then develop an emotional connection to it. And at some point, the hardest part is to develop the ethos, which says, I also respect and admire the others who are part of this with me, and it's ultimately for great organization, usually the ethos that will live on. And the ethos is what leads somebody to sacrifice themselves for the organization. A father or a mother sacrifices themselves for their child, because the ethos is part of the pathos and the logos. They want the child to survive, so the bloodline lives on. They care about the child because the child is their greatest achievement, and they see the child suffer and they can't see anything else but to die to save them. So if we imagine this journey that someone will go on, how do we take them along those steps? And what does it look like? What would it look like for you if you were to go down this path? So

Speaker 1  50:46  
I'm not going to use myself as an example, but I'm going to use your example. And the three things you just talked about, I think that the middle part, which is the pathos, is something that's found out before you find out the ethos and what was the first one. Again, Logos logic, exactly. So I think that the logos and the ethos are the two points of entry and the two points where it can actually start. I think that the ethos, let's say there's a draw numbers, let's say that there is a person that is a teacher, and that teacher sees that their school, their school needs more books, their school needs more funding. They want to be able to give bursaries, or they want to support their community in some way that's not just related to school. So today, I actually eat those but then that passion and that that want to be able to help people is going to drive them to find a way to help them, and that's going to make them look in like our our network would be able to connect them, but that's going to make them find a way to be able to do that mentors, mentors, or philanthropists or philanthropist, but philanthropist without money or job opportunities for the students as well job opportunities for the students. But it's also something with our business that might be able to make that ethos start their own business interesting. Or what if there is someone that sees a company in their town that they absolutely hate? They see this company buying properties. They see it stealing their water. They

Unknown Speaker  52:24  
hit Jeff Bezos exactly, ruining the world. So

Speaker 1  52:26  
let's say they see that, and they that's their passion, because they see it destroying their friends. They see it controlling that's an ethos. So their objective is to destroy that company. And how do you do that with competitive advantage and the opportunity? That's another way that it could become the first step.

Al Morris  52:43  
So the first step for people joining this might not be the Andrew Tave hustlers. It might be the people who care about building a better future. Yeah, it might be people who are frustrated because their hard work isn't going far enough to change the world.

Speaker 1  52:57  
And sometimes those people will be more of a hustler than anyone else, because their passion is fulfilling that need of their community,

Al Morris  53:05  
the self worth often are the greatest hustlers exactly because the priests. Priests developed a lot of early science, as did barbers. Barbers were some of the first surgeons, because they just cared about their customers, and

Speaker 1  53:17  
the Vatican doesn't share its library. When you go to a really good barber shop,

Unknown Speaker  53:21  
though, they just like

Unknown Speaker  53:22  
you. They do. They just, they want you

Al Morris  53:25  
to be happy, yeah, making your best self. And they really, really just care, especially like the Savant level, barbers are just

Speaker 1  53:31  
incredible. Now, what happens if you give an ethos a lot of money and they already solved their need? I think that they go further Exactly. They really do. That's my point. They're gonna find other things that they want to help with. But we already know that their values are true. They're not in it for self gain. Okay, wait, they're gonna start fixing other problems. I

Al Morris  53:49  
have a great example. There's this guy named Muhammad Yunus. He's currently leading Bangladesh. I'll keep this really short. I think this is a great place to end on. He's currently, he's just elected the leader of Bangladesh, and like a landslide, almost like a revolution, where a bunch of students got together and took over the government, and Muhammad Yunus was able to become the leader of Bangladesh because he had built social businesses, and he actually won a Nobel Peace Prize for building social businesses and writing a book On the concept. Okay, so Muhammad Yunus, whole idea was around building businesses and organizations that could sustain themselves for a greater good, for an ethos, by using the concepts of capitalism. Yeah. So one of the first businesses he built, which I read his book, social businesses. Yeah, and he built a business that was a yogurt company by buying a bunch of yogurt makers and using all the yogurt makers that he bought to give them out to grandmothers in small towns, and also training the grandmothers and paying for people to go into each town and find the right grandmother, asking around, finding the correct person, and then getting that grandmother with her grandchildren to make yogurt every day and have the grandchildren on their own workers, because of the loyalty to the matriarch of these families. Exactly so. By giving the yogurt machine and the supplies on a regular basis to the grandmothers they were able to produce yogurt. And then they would also set up the connections with the local people who owned cows and had excess milk to make it into yogurt before the milk went bad. And then they would make sure that the excess yogurt that wasn't purchased ended up in schools and orphanages and places where they could increase nutrition. So as those kids grew up, they recognized the brand name, yeah, and they would go and actually try to get jobs to help this system, because they like the values. And so when he started out, Bangladesh had a huge food insecurity problem for young children, and by the end of this they had helped literally 10s of millions of young children get enough nutrition to get through elementary school and junior high school and high school, and those are the students 30 years later that just kicked out the whole government of Bangladesh in a landslide of that nation in a democratic, peaceful protest, and put this guy in charge to do that with the rest of their economy. And the really cool thing about this, the amazing thing about this, is it didn't require any actual philanthropy. Yeah, nobody had to give money to this. They just needed a loan, yeah,

Speaker 1  56:24  
at a reasonable interest rate, they were able to start up at an idea.

Al Morris  56:27  
And the grandmothers made money off this. They were able to trade the yogurt for things that they needed so their families were more well off the kids for running the yogurt around town. Were also able to get school endurance to get into universities later. And everyone understood the economics of the system, so everyone got a degree in economics along the way, yeah, and a bunch of people were able to learn to read and write because of this thing. Because it's a lot of good data, it incentivized a lot of people to take time away from other things they were doing to help other people. And so if we can create a network like that that does that simultaneously by matchmaking people,

Speaker 1  56:59  
yeah, we don't want to be like the next Black Rock, or help someone become black rock. No centralization.

Al Morris  57:03  
The key is to return the power back to the edge. Yeah, this is actually probably the answer to the big fundamental question of AI, which everyone's struggling with right now, which is AI is a worse, fundamentally centralizing force than Wall Street. But the thing about this, that's cool, is AI, in this case, is more powerful in the hands of many individuals, yeah, than it is in the hands of one,

Speaker 1  57:26  
because we're literally just I see this as almost like not even us making profit. I stopped thinking about that entirely. I'm seeing this as us helping people do better, create jobs, increase their profits, or increase the jobs within their neighborhood, to connect and help people learn more and

Al Morris  57:44  
if you do that. Yeah, everyone makes a lot of money. Yeah, and the world becomes a better place. Yeah and the network will have ways that it can generate value for everyone involved.
